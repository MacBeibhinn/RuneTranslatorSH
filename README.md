# RuneTranslatorSH

Download the `rune_translator.sh` file, right click the file and view properties, ensure the file has the appropriate execute or run as program permissions, open the terminal and enter "./rune_translator.sh", or run the file from your file manager, or set the file as a command for a custom keyboard shortcut. There are ways to run the file in Windows, but this script was primarily created for/on Linux. Requires `zenity` by default, can be changed with some know-how.
